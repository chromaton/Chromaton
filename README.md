Chromaton
=========

Chromaton is a .NET library for syntax highlighting.  Our goal is to provide fast syntax highlighting for as many languages as possible.

Goals
-----

* Provide fast, simple text-highlighting capabilities for HTML and Windows applications.
* Support all of the .NET languages (Including F#, IronPython, and IronRuby)
* Maintain stylizations that are at least as robust as the common .NET IDEs.
* Support (in an extensible way) hybrid languages, such as HTML & JavaScript, ASPX & VB, and Razor & C#
